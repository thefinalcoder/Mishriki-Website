    <p>Hello World!</p>

    <h1>10/8/2024 Second Blog - QuickSort Analysis</h1>
    <p>Welcome back! Today, I’m diving into a key topic in computer science: sorting algorithms. More specifically, I’m analyzing QuickSort, a widely used divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Sorting Matters</h2>
    <p>Sorting algorithms play a fundamental role in computing. Efficient sorting leads to better performance in database indexing, search engine optimization, and even scientific computing. That’s why understanding the trade-offs between sorting algorithms is essential.</p>
    
    <h2>Understanding QuickSort</h2>
    <p>QuickSort is an efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm developed by Tony Hoare in 1959. It employs a divide-and-conquer approach, where a pivot element is selected, and the array is partitioned into two subarrays. The process is then applied recursively.</p>
    
    <h3>Algorithm Breakdown:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Divide:</b> Select a pivot and partition the array into elements smaller and greater than the pivot.</li>
        <li><b>Conquer:</b> Recursively apply QuickSort to the left and right subarrays.</li>
        <li><b>Combine:</b> Once sorted, merge the partitions back together.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Efficiency and Complexity</h2>
    <p>QuickSort’s efficiency largely depends on pivot selection. On average, it runs in O(n log n) time, making it faster than other comparison-based sorts like MergeSort for many use cases. However, in the worst case (when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element), it degrades to O(n²).</p>
    
    <h2>Best Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>General-purpose sorting in Python, Java, and C++.</li>
        <li>Optimized performance with random or partially sorted data.</li>
        <li>In-place sorting requiring minimal extra space.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>QuickSort may not be the best choice when data is already nearly sorted. MergeSort, which has a stable O(n log n) runtime, can be more reliable in such cases.</p>
